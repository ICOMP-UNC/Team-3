# üì¶ Controllable-Speed Conveyor Belt with Height Detection

Welcome to the Controllable-Speed Conveyor Belt project! This project leverages the STM32F103C8T6 Bluepill microcontroller and the libopencm3 library to create an advanced conveyor belt system with adjustable speed and height-based object detection. The system stops the conveyor if an object exceeds a defined height limit and uses a PID controller to adjust the belt's speed smoothly, accommodating different weights and perturbations. This project is built using PlatformIO.

## üöÄ Features

- **Controllable Speed**: Adjust the conveyor belt speed using a potentiometer.
- **Height Detection**: Measure object height using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, with height averaging and filtering.
- **Automatic Stopping**: Automatically stop the conveyor if an object exceeds the height limit.
- **LCD Display**: Display the measured height, status messages, and setpoint on a 16x2 LCD.
- **PID Controller**: Provides smooth motor control by adapting to weight and disturbance changes in real-time.
- **Input Management**: Start/stop button managed with EXTI-based interrupts and debounce handling for reliable control. Also a Switch is implemented to detect objects passing through.
- **System Updates**: Periodic system updates handle PID adjustments, height measurement, display refresh, and motor state management.
