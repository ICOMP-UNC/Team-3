# üì¶ Controllable-Speed Conveyor Belt with Height Detection

Welcome to the Controllable-Speed Conveyor Belt project! This project leverages the STM32F103C8T6 Bluepill microcontroller and the libopencm3 library to create a sophisticated conveyor belt system. The system is designed to detect the height of items passing through it and stop the conveyor belt whenever an item is too large. Additionally, it uses a PID controller to adapt to different weights and perturbations, ensuring smooth and efficient operation. The project is built using PlatformIO.

## üöÄ Features

- **Controllable Speed**: Adjust the speed of the conveyor belt using a potentiometer.
- **Height Detection**: Measure the height of items using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
- **Automatic Stopping**: Stop the conveyor belt if an item is too large.
- **LCD Display**: Display the measured height and status messages on a 16x2 LCD.
- **PID Controller**: Adapt to different weights and perturbations for smooth operation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware
